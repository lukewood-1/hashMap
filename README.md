# hashMap
These are hashmaps and hashsets, with an additional feature on the set() function. If there's already a key with the name you chose for the new key being added, you can return the to-be-replaced one by adding a **true** boolean as extra argument(ex: HashMap.set(key, value, true) and HashSet.set(key, true).
